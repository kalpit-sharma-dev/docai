Great question üëç ‚Äì let‚Äôs design this end-to-end pipeline for analysis + visualization of account statements after the LLM agent response.


---

üîπ Step 1: What the LLM Agent Sends

The agent should return a structured JSON like this:

{
  "summary": {
    "money_in": 280000,
    "money_out": 141000,
    "balance_trend": [
      {"month": "Apr", "balance": 310000},
      {"month": "May", "balance": 295000},
      {"month": "Jun", "balance": 285000},
      {"month": "Jul", "balance": 302000},
      {"month": "Aug", "balance": 318000},
      {"month": "Sep", "balance": 330000}
    ]
  },
  "categories": [
    {"name": "Payments", "amount": 58230, "percent": 41.3},
    {"name": "Investments", "amount": 50100, "percent": 35.6},
    {"name": "Others", "amount": 27300, "percent": 19.4},
    {"name": "Travel", "amount": 5400, "percent": 3.8}
  ],
  "top_merchants": [
    {"merchant": "FD", "amount": 63000},
    {"merchant": "Others", "amount": 20948},
    {"merchant": "HDFC Bank", "amount": 14556}
  ],
  "recurring": [
    {"type": "Salary", "amount": 230000, "frequency": "Monthly"},
    {"type": "Car Loan EMI", "amount": 18500, "frequency": "Monthly"},
    {"type": "SIP Mutual Fund", "amount": 10000, "frequency": "Monthly"}
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    {"date": "15-06-2025", "description": "High-value Shopping", "amount": 98000}
  ]
}

üîπ Step 2: What to Analyse

From this structured data, you can create insights:

1. Cash Flow

Net Savings = Money In ‚Äì Money Out

Trend of balances (healthy / declining / volatile).



2. Expense Breakdown

Categories (Payments, Investments, Travel, etc.).

Compare category changes month-to-month.



3. Top Merchants/Payees

Identify where money flows most.

Flag high dependence on a single merchant (risk).



4. Recurring Transactions

Salary, EMIs, SIPs (financial obligations).

Predictable commitments vs discretionary spend.



5. Anomalies

Outlier spends (possible fraud, unusual activity).



6. Forecast

AI-based expense & balance projection for next month.





---

üîπ Step 3: What to Visualize

Here‚Äôs how you can visualize each part:

Insight	Best Chart	Why

Money In vs Out	Side-by-side bar chart	Easy comparison
Monthly Balance Trend	Line/Area chart	Show growth/decline
Expense Categories	Donut/Pie chart	Category proportion
Top Merchants	Horizontal bar chart	Rank order clarity
Recurring Transactions	Timeline / Icon list	Show predictability
Anomalies	Highlighted scatter / table	Spot unusual points
Forecast Next Month	Line chart with dotted line	Show projection



---

üîπ Step 4: What Extra To Add (to make it useful)

Comparisons: ‚ÄúThis month‚Äôs expenses down by 20% vs last month.‚Äù

Benchmarks: ‚ÄúYou spent 35% of income on EMIs (safe < 40%).‚Äù

Alerts: ‚ÄúUnusual high-value debit of ‚Çπ98,000 detected.‚Äù

Goals/Advice: ‚ÄúIf you save ‚Çπ20,000/month, you‚Äôll reach ‚Çπ5L in 2 years.‚Äù

Filters: Allow user to filter charts by category, merchant, or time.

Drilldown: Click a chart slice ‚Üí show raw transactions.



---

üîπ Step 5: Example UI Flow

1. Dashboard Card:

Money In ‚Çπ2.8L, Money Out ‚Çπ1.41L (with % change indicator).



2. Charts Section:

Donut chart for categories.

Line chart for 6-month balance trend.

Bar chart for top merchants.



3. Insights Panel:

Key highlights like ‚ÄúExpenses down 48.8% this month.‚Äù



4. Anomalies Section:

Table of flagged unusual spends.



5. Advice Section:

AI suggestions: budget, savings tips, investment advice.





---

‚ö° So the flow is:
Raw Statement ‚Üí LLM Extraction ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí Analytics Engine ‚Üí Visualizations + Insights in UI.

Would you like me to mock a JSON + UI wireframe (with charts) for your case so you can directly plug it into React Native (Expo) for your Instagram-like project dashboard?
